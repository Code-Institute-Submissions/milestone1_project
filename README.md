# Milestone Project 1 for Fullstack Web Developer Course

This is a static web page that is for fans of 'The Monkees' band to view some of their previous (and future) work, along with being able to contact them in order to book an event


 
## UX
 
Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.
### Design

I went for a single scrolling page design, as while it meant that the initial load time might be slightly longer than if the site was split into multiple pages, the User would have full access to all the content.
From a coding perspective, it also makes it simpler to maintain, as a link would only need to be changed once, instead of having to be changed on multiple files.

For the general design (See the Design Documents Section), I went with a standard Header and Footer with a menu bar situated just below the header. Initially I did plan for a header image to appear at the top of the page, but after reviewing the planned image ('assets/images/monkees.jpg'),this would not fit with the view that I had.

Considering that the main target of this website is for fans, A static header and footer seemed to be the best method, particulaly since there was a permanent link to the booking form in the footer. 

The color scheme was generated using a w3 schools tool (See the **Tools** Section)
### User Stories

- As a event organiser, I want to book them for my event, so that I can then state that they would be playing live on the night.
- As a new fan of the band, I want to find out some of the history about the band
- As a longtime fan, I want to listen to some of their tracks and music video(s)



### Design Documents

- Initial Design document(s), including a font test to preview what the fonts would look like are available from the 'designs' folder


## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
- Another feature idea

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
    - The project uses the 'Lobster' and 'Roboto' fonts which are available from this font repository for free use.
- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.
- [Bootstrap v3.3](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/)
    - The project uses **Bootstrap** for the navbar functionality, along with making the images responsive and responsive visibility classes.

### Tools

- [W3 Schools Color Scheme - Triadic](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_triadic.asp)
    - I used this tool to help me create a color scheme for use in the site.

## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

--Manual Testing Only--



## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

### Github   

The site is available to view via [here](https://lowe54.github.io/milestone1_project/)

The following steps were made in order to deploy
- In a terminal, the git repository was initiated via the 'git init' command



In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.

In order to create a local copy, or to clone the git respository:
